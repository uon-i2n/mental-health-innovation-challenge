# mental-health-innovation-challenge
15-16 March, 2024. Health Innovation Living Lab

The Innovation Challenge is a broad event designed to build a robust solution to a specific problem. In this challenge, the HNECC PHN is seeking new and innovative early intervention solutions that empower individuals to identify a decline in mental fitness. During the Challenge event, you will hear from industry experts about the problem of mental fitness and then form interdisciplinary teams (Friday night). On the Saturday, the challenge will begin, where you will research deeply into the problem landscape and begin to develop your idea or solution. You will be guided by mentors throughout the Saturday and finally deliver a 5-minute presentation to judges discussing your solutionsâ€™ merits according to the marking criteria for the chance to win cash prizes. In this challenge, we are bringing together multidisciplinary minds to explore equitable and accessible solutions to improve the mental fitness of our community.
